# Scripts for the Knowles et al. manuscript 
## Goal
This set of Matlab/Octave scripts calculates: 
- the probability of a phytoplankton cell of encountering the walls of a container after a given time interval
- the probability of a phytoplankton cell of encountering randomly distributed viruses after a given time interval
- the apparent growth rate (AGR) of a phytoplanktonic community confined in a volume of water 

## Parameters for the calculations

- time_experiment = time interval for the numerical experiment (in seconds)
- D_vals = values of diffusion coefficient tested (in cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>)
- dilutions = dilution levels used (in %)
- volume = volume of the container where the numerical experiment is set (in cm<sup>3</sup>) 
- conc = concentration of phytoplankton cells (in # cm<sup>-3</sup>)
- num_exp = number of replicates for the numerical experiment 
- hv_ratio = virus:host ratio
